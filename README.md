# Macro-Project

This macro program allows the user to create character sequences that can be replaced with another sequence of the user's choice. Character sequences and their expansions can be saved to a file to be loaded later.

To see how it works, you can watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAFW7KQTIm0).
